	abstract = {The interplay among magnetism, electronic nematicity, and superconductivity is the key issue in strongly correlated materials including iron-based, cuprate, and heavy-fermion superconductors. Magnetic fluctuations have been widely discussed as a pairing mechanism of unconventional superconductivity, but recent theory predicts that quantum fluctuations of nematic order may also promote high-temperature superconductivity. This has been studied in FeSe 1‚àí x S x superconductors exhibiting nonmagnetic nematic and pressure-induced antiferromagnetic orders, but its abrupt suppression of superconductivity at the nematic end point leaves the nematic-fluctuation driven superconductivity unconfirmed. Here we report on systematic studies of high-pressure phase diagrams up to 8 GPa in high-quality single crystals of FeSe 1‚àí x Te x . When Te composition x (Te) becomes larger than 0.1, the high-pressure magnetic order disappears, whereas the pressure-induced superconducting dome near the nematic end point is continuously found up to x (Te) ‚âà 0.5. In contrast to FeSe 1‚àí x S x , enhanced superconductivity in FeSe 1‚àí x Te x does not correlate with magnetism but with the suppression of nematicity, highlighting the paramount role of nonmagnetic nematic fluctuations for high-temperature superconductivity in this system.},

Whereas the effects of Berry curvature have been observed through phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional electron gases and the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in ferromagnets, the quantum metric has rarely been explored. Here, we report a nonlinear Hall effect induced by the quantum metric dipole by interfacing even-layered MnBi2Te4 with black phosphorus. The quantum metric nonlinear Hall effect switches direction upon reversing the antiferromagnetic (AFM) spins and exhibits distinct scaling that is independent of the scattering time.

We analyze the ac-dc power conversion efficiency of such ‚ÄúHall rectifier‚Äù and suggest its application in wireless charging and energy harvesting. Our key observation is that the development of Hall voltage results in a change of longitudinal resistance, resulting in a violation of Ohm's law due to the nonlinear Hall effect. This feedback mechanism balances the input power and the output power and hence is crucial for the understanding of the power transfer from source to load. We derive a general expression for the power conversion efficiency in terms of material parameters, external load resistance, and input power. As the Hall current is perpendicular to the electric field and does not generate Joule heating by itself, we obtain high power conversion efficiency when the Hall angle (which increases with the input power) is large and the load resistance is optimized. Promising materials for high-efficiency Hall rectifiers are also discussed.},

Such systems have recently been extended to non-centrosymmetric superconductors, and the superconducting diode effect has been observed. Here, we report an antiferromagnetic diode effect in a centrosymmetric crystal without directional charge separation. We observed large second-harmonic transport in a nonlinear electronic device enabled by the compensated antiferromagnetic state of even-layered MnBi2Te4. We show that this antiferromagnetic diode effect can be used to create in-plane field-effect transistors and microwave-energy-harvesting devices.

	abstract = {Non-reciprocal charge transport has gained significant attention due to its potential in exploring quantum symmetry and its promising applications. Traditionally, non-reciprocal transport has been observed in the longitudinal direction, with non-reciprocal resistance being a small fraction of the ohmic resistance. Here we report a transverse non-reciprocal transport phenomenon featuring a quadratic current‚Äìvoltage characteristic and divergent non-reciprocity, termed the non-reciprocal Hall effect. This effect is observed in microscale Hall devices fabricated from platinum (Pt) deposited by a focused ion beam on silicon substrates. The transverse non-reciprocal Hall effect arises from the geometrically asymmetric scattering of textured Pt nanoparticles within the focused-ion-beam-deposited Pt structures. Notably, the non-reciprocal Hall effect generated in focused-ion-beam-deposited Pt electrodes can propagate to adjacent conductors such as Au and NbP through Hall current injection. Additionally, this pronounced non-reciprocal Hall effect facilitates broadband frequency mixing. These findings not only validate the non-reciprocal Hall effect concept but also open avenues for its application in terahertz communication, imaging and energy harvesting.},
