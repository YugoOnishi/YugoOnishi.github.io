	abstract = {The interplay among magnetism, electronic nematicity, and superconductivity is the key issue in strongly correlated materials including iron-based, cuprate, and heavy-fermion superconductors. Magnetic fluctuations have been widely discussed as a pairing mechanism of unconventional superconductivity, but recent theory predicts that quantum fluctuations of nematic order may also promote high-temperature superconductivity. This has been studied in FeSe 1‚àí x S x superconductors exhibiting nonmagnetic nematic and pressure-induced antiferromagnetic orders, but its abrupt suppression of superconductivity at the nematic end point leaves the nematic-fluctuation driven superconductivity unconfirmed. Here we report on systematic studies of high-pressure phase diagrams up to 8 GPa in high-quality single crystals of FeSe 1‚àí x Te x . When Te composition x (Te) becomes larger than 0.1, the high-pressure magnetic order disappears, whereas the pressure-induced superconducting dome near the nematic end point is continuously found up to x (Te) ‚âà 0.5. In contrast to FeSe 1‚àí x S x , enhanced superconductivity in FeSe 1‚àí x Te x does not correlate with magnetism but with the suppression of nematicity, highlighting the paramount role of nonmagnetic nematic fluctuations for high-temperature superconductivity in this system.},

Here, we report a nonlinear Hall effect induced by the quantum metric dipole by interfacing even-layered MnBi2Te4 with black phosphorus.

Our key observation is that the development of Hall voltage results in a change of longitudinal resistance, resulting in a violation of Ohm's law due to the nonlinear Hall effect. This feedback mechanism balances the input power and the output power and hence is crucial for the understanding of the power transfer from source to load. We derive a general expression for the power conversion efficiency in terms of material parameters, external load resistance, and input power. As the Hall current is perpendicular to the electric field and does not generate Joule heating by itself, we obtain high power conversion efficiency when the Hall angle (which increases with the input power) is large and the load resistance is optimized. Promising materials for high-efficiency Hall rectifiers are also discussed.},

Traditionally, non-reciprocal transport has been observed in the longitudinal direction, with non-reciprocal resistance being a small fraction of the ohmic resistance. Here we report a transverse non-reciprocal transport phenomenon featuring a quadratic current‚Äìvoltage characteristic and divergent non-reciprocity, termed the non-reciprocal Hall effect. This effect is observed in microscale Hall devices fabricated from platinum (Pt) deposited by a focused ion beam on silicon substrates. The transverse non-reciprocal Hall effect arises from the geometrically asymmetric scattering of textured Pt nanoparticles within the focused-ion-beam-deposited Pt structures. Notably, the non-reciprocal Hall effect generated in focused-ion-beam-deposited Pt electrodes can propagate to adjacent conductors such as Au and NbP through Hall current injection. Additionally, this pronounced non-reciprocal Hall effect facilitates broadband frequency mixing. These findings not only validate the non-reciprocal Hall effect concept but also open avenues for its application in terahertz communication, imaging and energy harvesting.},

The quantum weight carries a wealth of information about dielectric responses and optical properties of the system and is closely related to its quantum geometry. For systems with short-range interactions or low-dimensional Coulomb systems, we show that the many-body quantum metric (which measures the change of the ground state under twisted boundary conditions) can be determined directly from the quantum weight. Notably, the quantum weight is a property of a single ground state and independent of boundary conditions in the thermodynamic limit. Our finding thus enables direct experimental measurement and numerical calculation of the many-body quantum metric. On the other hand, for three-dimensional Coulomb systems, we show that the quantum weight is distinct from the many-body quantum metric due to dielectric screening in three dimensions. We further use dielectric sum rules to derive upper and lower bounds on the quantum weight of real materials in terms of their electron density, static dielectric constant, and plasmon energy. Our work highlights quantum weight as a fundamental material parameter, which can be experimentally determined by x-ray scattering or electron-loss spectroscopy.},

	abstract = {We show that a quadratic form of the quantum geometric tensor in ùëò space sets a bound on the ùëû4 term in the static structure factor ùëÜ‚Å°(ùëû) at small ùíí. Bands that saturate this bound satisfy a condition similar to Laplace's equation, leading us to refer to them as harmonic bands. We provide examples of harmonic bands in one- and two-dimensional systems, including (higher) Landau levels. The geometric bound further leads to a topological bound on the ùëû4 term, which is saturated only when the band geometry satisfies the trace condition and, additionally, the quantum geometric tensor is uniform in ùëò space. We speculate that these bounds taken together provide a useful guide for identifying Chern bands that favor (Abelian or non-Abelian) fractional Chern insulators.},
