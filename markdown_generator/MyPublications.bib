	abstract = {A thermoelectric effect of the noncentrosymmetric electron-phonon coupled system is proposed, in which a temperature difference between electrons and phonons, instead of a spatial temperature gradient, induces an electric current. This is a realization of the Seebeck ratchet in solids with the asymmetric energy dispersion of electrons, and the dynamical phonons act as the fluctuation of the scalar potential and induce the dc current. Possible realizations of this mechanism are also discussed.},

	abstract = {We propose a heat current analog of the shift current, ‚Äúshift heat current.‚Äù We study nonlinear heat current responses to an applied ac electric field by a diagrammatic method and derive a microscopic expression for the second-order dc heat current response. As a result, we find that the shift heat current is related to the shift vector, a geometric quantity that also appears in the expression for the shift current. The shift heat current directly depends on and can be controlled through the chemical potential. In addition, we apply the diagrammatic method to electron-phonon coupled systems, and we find that even if only the phonons are excited by an external field, the amplitude of the shift heat current is determined by the energy scale of electrons, not of phonons.},

	abstract = {We theoretically study photocurrents in metals that break both inversion P and time reversal T symmetries within the transparent region. We find that the system under the ac electric fields is well described with an effective Hamiltonian and the photocurrent is of the order of O(œâJ/Œ≥) if the frequency of the induced current œâJ and the scattering rate Œ≥ satisfy œâJ/Œ≥‚â™1, and vanishes in the limit of œâJ/Œ≥‚Üí0. On the other hand, the effective Hamiltonian description indicates that nonvanishing photocurrent can appear even in the transparent region if the system is thin enough compared to the mean-free path in the direction of the induced current (where Œ≥ can be effectively regarded as 0). Candidate materials for the such photovoltaic effect within the transparent region include conducting multiferroics breaking both P and T symmetries.},

	abstract = {The interplay among magnetism, electronic nematicity, and superconductivity is the key issue in strongly correlated materials including iron-based, cuprate, and heavy-fermion superconductors. Magnetic fluctuations have been widely discussed as a pairing mechanism of unconventional superconductivity, but recent theory predicts that quantum fluctuations of nematic order may also promote high-temperature superconductivity. This has been studied in FeSe1‚àíxSx superconductors exhibiting nonmagnetic nematic and pressure-induced antiferromagnetic orders, but its abrupt suppression of superconductivity at the nematic end point leaves the nematic-fluctuation driven superconductivity unconfirmed. Here we report on systematic studies of high-pressure phase diagrams up to 8‚ÄâGPa in high-quality single crystals of FeSe1‚àíxTex. When Te composition x(Te) becomes larger than 0.1, the high-pressure magnetic order disappears, whereas the pressure-induced superconducting dome near the nematic end point is continuously found up to x(Te)‚Äâ‚âà‚Äâ0.5. In contrast to FeSe1‚àíxSx, enhanced superconductivity in FeSe1‚àíxTex does not correlate with magnetism but with the suppression of nematicity, highlighting the paramount role of nonmagnetic nematic fluctuations for high-temperature superconductivity in this system.},

	abstract = {When a symmetry-breaking phase of matter is suppressed to a quantum critical point (QCP) at absolute zero, quantum-mechanical fluctuations proliferate. Such fluctuations can lead to unconventional superconductivity, as evidenced by the superconducting domes often found near magnetic QCPs in correlated materials. Experimentally, however, it remains much less clear whether the superconductivity can be promoted around QCPs of the electronic nematic phase, characterized by rotational symmetry breaking. Here, we demonstrate from systematic elastoresistivity measurements that nonmagnetic FeSe

	abstract = {Quantum geometry in condensed-matter physics has two components: the real part quantum metric and the imaginary part Berry curvature. Whereas the effects of Berry curvature have been observed through phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional electron gases and the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in ferromagnets, the quantum metric has rarely been explored. Here, we report a nonlinear Hall effect induced by the quantum metric dipole by interfacing even-layered MnBi2Te4 with black phosphorus. The quantum metric nonlinear Hall effect switches direction upon reversing the antiferromagnetic (AFM) spins and exhibits distinct scaling that is independent of the scattering time. Our results open the door to discovering quantum metric responses predicted theoretically and pave the way for applications that bridge nonlinear electronics with AFM spintronics.},
