  abstract = {Nonreciprocal and nonlinear transport responses enable key functionalities for energy harvesting, frequency mixing, and magnetic-state detection. Traditionally, nonlinear conduction has been observed in non-centrosymmetric crystals or in ferromagnet/heavy-metal heterostructures. Here, we demonstrate a new mechanism for generating strong nonlinear transport in chromium sulfide bromide (CrSBr), a magnetic semiconductor with a centrosymmetric crystal structure. Instead of relying on a crystal lattice or heterostructure to break the requisite symmetries that prohibit nonlinear transport, we directly utilize gate voltage to induce an asymmetric band structure in the magnetic semiconductor through Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC), resulting in intrinsic transport nonreciprocity and nonlinearity. Remarkably, the strength of the observed nonlinearity exceeds typical magnetic heterostructure values by several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the nonlinear transport demonstrates a high tunability with the applied gate voltage, explained by a minimalistic two-band model. These findings establish magnetic semiconductors as powerful platforms for exploring the interplay between SOC and magnetism and for advancing our understanding of nonreciprocal electronic transport.},

  abstract = {In a p–n junction, the separation of positive and negative charges leads to diode transport, in which charge flows in only one direction. Non-centrosymmetric polar conductors are intrinsic diodes that could be of use in the development of nonlinear applications. Such systems have recently been extended to non-centrosymmetric superconductors, and the superconducting diode effect has been observed. Here, we report an antiferromagnetic diode effect in a centrosymmetric crystal without directional charge separation. We observed large second-harmonic transport in a nonlinear electronic device enabled by the compensated antiferromagnetic state of even-layered MnBi2Te4. We show that this antiferromagnetic diode effect can be used to create in-plane field-effect transistors and microwave-energy-harvesting devices. We also show that electrical sum-frequency generation can be used as a tool to detect nonlinear responses in quantum materials.},

Whereas the effects of Berry curvature have been observed through phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional electron gases and the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in ferromagnets, the quantum metric has rarely been explored. Here, we report a nonlinear Hall effect induced by the quantum metric dipole by interfacing even-layered MnBi2Te4 with black phosphorus.

We show that three-septuple-layer MnBi2Te4 film exhibit an enhanced, almost-perfect magnetic circular dichroism for a narrow photon energy window in the infrared region.

  abstract = {When a symmetry-breaking phase of matter is suppressed to a quantum critical point (QCP) at absolute zero, quantum-mechanical fluctuations proliferate. Such fluctuations can lead to unconventional superconductivity, as evidenced by the superconducting domes often found near magnetic QCPs in correlated materials. Experimentally, however, it remains much less clear whether the superconductivity can be promoted around QCPs of the electronic nematic phase, characterized by rotational symmetry breaking. Here, we demonstrate from systematic elastoresistivity measurements that nonmagnetic FeSe 1 − 𝑥  Tex exhibits an electronic nematic QCP showing diverging nematic susceptibility. This finding establishes two nematic QCPs in FeSe-based superconductors with contrasting accompanying phase diagrams. In FeSe 1 − 𝑥  Tex, a superconducting dome is centered at the QCP, whereas FeSe 1 − 𝑥  Sx shows no QCP-associated enhancement of superconductivity. We find that this difference is related to the relative strength of nematic and spin fluctuations. Our results in FeSe 1 − 𝑥  Tex present the unprecedented case in support of the superconducting dome being associated with the QCP of pure electronic nematic order, which does not intertwine with any other long-range orders.},

  abstract = {Non-reciprocal charge transport has gained significant attention due to its potential in exploring quantum symmetry and its promising applications. Traditionally, non-reciprocal transport has been observed in the longitudinal direction, with non-reciprocal resistance being a small fraction of the ohmic resistance. Here we report a transverse non-reciprocal transport phenomenon featuring a quadratic current–voltage characteristic and divergent non-reciprocity, termed the non-reciprocal Hall effect. This effect is observed in microscale Hall devices fabricated from platinum (Pt) deposited by a focused ion beam on silicon substrates. The transverse non-reciprocal Hall effect arises from the geometrically asymmetric scattering of textured Pt nanoparticles within the focused-ion-beam-deposited Pt structures. Notably, the non-reciprocal Hall effect generated in focused-ion-beam-deposited Pt electrodes can propagate to adjacent conductors such as Au and NbP through Hall current injection. Additionally, this pronounced non-reciprocal Hall effect facilitates broadband frequency mixing. These findings not only validate the non-reciprocal Hall effect concept but also open avenues for its application in terahertz communication, imaging and energy harvesting.},

  abstract = {The interplay among magnetism, electronic nematicity, and superconductivity is the key issue in strongly correlated materials including iron-based, cuprate, and heavy-fermion superconductors. Magnetic fluctuations have been widely discussed as a pairing mechanism of unconventional superconductivity, but recent theory predicts that quantum fluctuations of nematic order may also promote high-temperature superconductivity. This has been studied in FeSe 1− x S x superconductors exhibiting nonmagnetic nematic and pressure-induced antiferromagnetic orders, but its abrupt suppression of superconductivity at the nematic end point leaves the nematic-fluctuation driven superconductivity unconfirmed. Here we report on systematic studies of high-pressure phase diagrams up to 8 GPa in high-quality single crystals of FeSe 1− x Te x . When Te composition x (Te) becomes larger than 0.1, the high-pressure magnetic order disappears, whereas the pressure-induced superconducting dome near the nematic end point is continuously found up to x (Te) ≈ 0.5. In contrast to FeSe 1− x S x , enhanced superconductivity in FeSe 1− x Te x does not correlate with magnetism but with the suppression of nematicity, highlighting the paramount role of nonmagnetic nematic fluctuations for high-temperature superconductivity in this system.},

We analyze the ac-dc power conversion efficiency of such “Hall rectifier” and suggest its application in wireless charging and energy harvesting. Our key observation is that the development of Hall voltage results in a change of longitudinal resistance, resulting in a violation of Ohm's law due to the nonlinear Hall effect. This feedback mechanism balances the input power and the output power and hence is crucial for the understanding of the power transfer from source to load. We derive a general expression for the power conversion efficiency in terms of material parameters, external load resistance, and input power. As the Hall current is perpendicular to the electric field and does not generate Joule heating by itself, we obtain high power conversion efficiency when the Hall angle (which increases with the input power) is large and the load resistance is optimized. Promising materials for high-efficiency Hall rectifiers are also discussed.},

The quantum weight carries a wealth of information about dielectric responses and optical properties of the system and is closely related to its quantum geometry. For systems with short-range interactions or low-dimensional Coulomb systems, we show that the many-body quantum metric (which measures the change of the ground state under twisted boundary conditions) can be determined directly from the quantum weight. Notably, the quantum weight is a property of a single ground state and independent of boundary conditions in the thermodynamic limit. Our finding thus enables direct experimental measurement and numerical calculation of the many-body quantum metric. On the other hand, for three-dimensional Coulomb systems, we show that the quantum weight is distinct from the many-body quantum metric due to dielectric screening in three dimensions. We further use dielectric sum rules to derive upper and lower bounds on the quantum weight of real materials in terms of their electron density, static dielectric constant, and plasmon energy. Our work highlights quantum weight as a fundamental material parameter, which can be experimentally determined by x-ray scattering or electron-loss spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {We study the polarization response to a temperature gradient in insulators, known as the thermopolarization effect. We show that this response can be understood through the free energy response function to an electric field gradient, which we call the Q tensor. By using the Q tensor, we present a unified description of the polarization responses to both electric fields and temperature gradients and derive the generalized Mott relation. Additionally, we draw an analogy with the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects. These effects are observable as the Seebeck effect when the system’s linear size is shorter than the screening length.},

  abstract = {We show that the static structure factor of general many-body systems with U(1) symmetry has a lower bound determined only by the ground state Chern number. Our bound relies only on causality and non-negative energy dissipation, and holds for a wide range of two-dimensional gapped systems. We apply our theory to (fractional) Chern insulators, (fractional) quantum spin Hall insulators, topological superconductors, and chiral spin liquids. Our results uncover a universal feature of topological phases beyond the quantized response.},

  abstract = {We establish a universal relation between the energy gap and the static dielectric constant for all insulating states. This relation yields an upper bound on the energy gap, which only depends on the electron density and electronic dielectric constant. We identify two types of energy gaps associated with transverse and longitudinal excitations at long wavelengths, which correspond to the optical gap and the plasmon energy, respectively. Their upper bounds are set by the dielectric constant and its inverse respectively. The transverse gap bound is calculated for a wide range of materials and compared with the measured optical gap. A remarkable case is cubic boron nitride, in which the direct gap reaches 72\% of the bound. Our results are derived from the Kramers-Kronig relation and the 𝑓-sum rule and therefore rest on general physical principles.},
